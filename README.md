Walmart Store Growth

Inspired by http://projects.flowingdata.com/walmart/
I have created a D3 version of the same.

To run first clone the source:
```haskell
git clone https://github.com/nizantz/walmart-growth.git
```

Go to the root folder:
```haskell
cd ~/walmart-growth
```
Start server (on mac) :
```haskell
/usr/bin/python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5555
```

Access the URL -> http://localhost:5555

TODO : Store count
