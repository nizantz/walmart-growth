Inspired by http://flowingdata.com/2010/04/07/watching-the-growth-of-walmart-now-with-100-more-sams-club/
created by Nathan Yau "http://flowingdata.com/about-nathan", I have created a D3 version of the same.
For moving through the years , I have used chroniton, a time slider (https://github.com/xaranke/chroniton)

To run first clone the source:
```haskell
git clone https://github.com/nizantz/walmart-growth.git
```

Go to the root folder:
```haskell
cd ~/walmart-growth
```
Start server (on mac) :
```haskell
/usr/bin/python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5555
```

Access the URL -> http://localhost:5555
